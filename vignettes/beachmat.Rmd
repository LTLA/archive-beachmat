# A common C++ API for all types of R matrices
Package: `r Rpackage("beachmat")` <br />
Author: Aaron Lun (alun@wehi.edu.au) <br />
Compilation date: `r Sys.Date()`

# Introduction

This package provides a C++ API for extraction of data in a variety of R matrix types.
The aim is to facilitate data processing in R packages using C++ extensions to handle the matrices.
This is especially pertinent when the exact type of matrix is unknown.

# Overview of the API

## Linking to the package

We will assume that readers have a working knowledge of R's C-level API.
See https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html for details.
We also assume that readers are familiar with C++.

## An example with a numeric matrix

The use of the API is demonstr
We include the relevant header file for a numeric matrix (in this case, `numeric_matrix.h`):

```
#include "numeric_matrix.h"
```

A double-precision matrix object `dmat` is handled in C++ by passing the `SEXP` struct from `.Call` to `create_numeric_matrix`:

```
std::shared_dptr<numeric_matrix> dptr=create_numeric_matrix(dmat);
```

This creates a shared pointer that points to an object of the `numeric_matrix` virtual class.
The exact class depends on the type of matrix in `dmat`, though the behaviour of the user-level functions are not affected by this detail.
(Note that this requires C++11 to work.)

The available methods for this object are:

- `dptr->get_nrow()` returns an integer number of rows (`nrow`).
- `dptr->get_ncol()` returns an integer number of columns (`ncol`).
- `dptr->get_row(r)` returns a constant pointer to an array of doubles of length `ncol`, containing values at row `r`.
- `dptr->get_col(c)` returns a constant pointer to an array of doubles of length `nrow`, containing values at column `c`.
- `dptr->get(r, c)` returns a double at matrix entry `(r, c)`.

In all cases, `r` and `c` should be non-negative integers in `[0, nrow)` and `[0, ncol)` respectively.
Zero-based indexing is used, as is standard for most C/C++ applications.

## Other matrix types

Logical and integer matrices are also supported, by including the following header files:

```
#include "logical_matrix.h"
#include "integer_matrix.h"
```

The creation function changes correspondingly, for logical matrix `lmat` and integer matrix `imat`:

```
std::shared_ptr<logical_matrix> lptr=create_logical_matrix(lmat);
std::shared_ptr<integer_matrix> iptr=create_integer_matrix(imat);
```

Here, the `get_row` and `get_col` methods return pointers to integer arrays, while `get` returns an integer.

## Important developer information 

__NOTE:__ A pointer returned by `get_row` is not guaranteed to be valid after another call to `get_row`.
The same applies for pointers returned by `get_col` after another call to `get_col`.
This is because these pointers refer to internal arrays within each instance of the `*_matrix` class, which are overwritten upon repeated calls to the above methods.

```
const double* x=dptr->get_row(0);
x[0]; // First entry of first row, okay.
const double* y=dptr->get_row(1);
x[0]; // Not guaranteed to be unchanged!
```

If the values need to be stored, copy the values from the returned pointer into your own chunk of memory.

```
const double* x=dptr->get_row(0);
std::copy(x, x+dptr->get_ncol(), z); // Assuming you have some pointer z.
const double* y=dptr->get_row(1);
z[0]; // First entry of first row, okay.
```

For this reason, the current API is unlikely to be safe if there are multiple shared pointers to the same `*_matrix` instance (e.g., with multiple threads).

__NOTE:__ The API will happily throw exceptions of the `std::exception` class, containing an informative error message.
These should be caught and handled gracefully by the end-user code, otherwise a segmentation fault will probably occur.
See the error-handling mechanism in `r CRANpkg("Rcpp")` for an example of how to deal with these exceptions.

# Supported matrix types

The following matrix classes are supported:

- numeric: `matrix`, `dgeMatrix`, `dgCMatrix`, `dgTMatrix`, `dspMatrix`, `HDF5Matrix`
- integer: `matrix`, `HDF5Matrix`
- logical: `matrix`, `lgeMatrix`, `lgCMatrix`, `lgTMatrix`, `lspMatrix`, `HDF5Matrix`

Additional classes can be added on a need-to-use basis.
As a general rule, if a matrix-like object can be stored in a `SummarizedExperiment` class (from the `r Biocpkg("SummarizedExperiment")` package), the API should be able to handle it.
Please contact the maintainers if you have a class that you would like to see supported.
